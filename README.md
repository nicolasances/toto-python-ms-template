# Template for Toto Python Microservices

This is a template project that will allow you to create, build and deploy a Toto Microservice. <br>
It supports two types of Runtime Environments: 
* AWS on ECS
* GCP on Cloud Run

This documentation will guide you through the process of using this template to create, build and deploy your new Toto Microservice.

## 1. Clone this Repo and Detach
The first thing to do is to clone this repo. <br>
You should change the name of the target folder with the following command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/nicolasances/toto-python-ms-template toto-ms-<your-ms-name>
```

After cloning, you need to detach from the template repo. You can do this by using the following command: 
```
git remote rm origin
```

## 2. Create the Microservice
Use Toto API Controller to create your microservice skeleton. <br>
Follow the instructions in this repo: https://github.com/nicolasances/py-toto-api-controller.

Remember, before doing anything, to **create a Python Virtual Environment**!
```
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate.
```
Always run `which python` to make sure you're now using the version of python in the venv.

## 3. Deploy the Microservice
* [Guide to Deploy on AWS ECS](./docs/aws/aws-ecs-guide.md)
* [Guide to Deploy on GCP Cloud Run](./docs/gcp/config-gcp.md)

## 4. Test that it works
To test this, use Postman, and call with the following paramters:
* HTTP Method: **`GET`**
* URL: **https://<configured API domain>/**
* Headers: 
    * `toto-service`: <name of your microservice> (e.g. toto-ms-expenses)


## 4. Troubleshooting and Known Errors
### Error on urllib
If you get the following error: 
> ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 3) and urllib3==2.2.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
Just remove urllib from `requirements.txt`
